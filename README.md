# üí´ About Me:
<br>üëã Hey everyone! I‚Äôm Shivam Arora, a sophomore at Villanova University, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Economics. My academic journey bridges tech innovation with the intricacies of economic systems, fueling my passion for solving real-world problems using tech.<br><br>üíª Whether it‚Äôs crafting projects like "Second Spin," a marketplace for secondhand goods, or "Budget Buddy," an expense tracker for students, I‚Äôm constantly exploring the power of technology to streamline everyday life. With tools like React, MongoDB, and Node.js, I enjoy bringing ideas to life.<br><br>üåü I had the opportunity to gain valuable experience at Ernst & Young as a summer intern and currently assist with classroom technology on campus, focusing on finding practical and creative solutions to everyday challenges.<br><br>üöÄ Looking ahead, I‚Äôm diving into machine learning and exploring cutting-edge AI concepts to leverage their potential in shaping future projects that are smarter, more efficient, and impactful. But for now, you can catch me rallying on the badminton court or collaborating with Villanova‚Äôs dynamic student organizations!<br>
